    "# Python 2.7 vs 3.X\n",
    "- support for 2.7 ended in Jan 2020!!\n",
    "- If you find this issue fascinating, there's no shortage of lengthly things to read \n",

    "  - OpenStack, the largest open source python project, is [porting to 3.X](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Python3)\n",
    "- [py3readiness.org](http://py3readiness.org) shows what popular packages have been ported to 3.X\n",
    "- unicode was added as an afterthought to 2.7\n",
    "    - source of many bugs and inconsistencies\n",
    "    - developers felt unicode had to be fully embraced if Python was to thrive in non-English cultures\n",
    "- \"as long as we're making incompatible changes, may as well fix some other stuff while we're at it\"\n",
    "- in 2.7:\n",
    "    - print is a statement, not a function\n",
    "    - many calls, like 'range', are memory inefficient, and were designed before the iteration protocol\n",
    "- there was great resistance to 3.X for several years, but seems like tide has turned\n",
    "- new projects should use 3.X\n",

    "    - with -w arg, will update file in place\n",
    "    - among other things, will convert 2.7 'print statements' into 3.X 'print functions'\n",
